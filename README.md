High-Frequency Interconnect Design for Silicon Die
Overview
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Grounded Coplanar Waveguide (GCPW) transmission line and silicon die interconnect optimized for 50 GHz operation.
The goal was to achieve low reflection (S11/S22 < –10 dB), stable impedance, and minimal parasitic inductance for high-speed chip-to-package signal integrity.

Objectives
Design a high-frequency transmission path between a silicon die and PCB.

Optimize wirebond configuration, via dimensions, and trace geometry for minimal signal degradation.

Validate performance using ANSYS HFSS electromagnetic simulations.

Design Highlights
Wirebond Configuration: 5× parallel wirebonds (25 µm diameter) to reduce inductance.

Trace Width: 300 µm signal width for impedance matching.

Via Optimization: 200 µm signal via diameter, 300 µm pad size, 150 µm ground spacing.

Layout: Symmetrical grounding and via stitching to enhance return path and reduce crosstalk.

Key Results
Achieved S11/S22 below –10 dB across 0–50 GHz.

Minimized insertion loss while maintaining consistent impedance.

Improved high-frequency performance by tuning trace/via geometry and ground configuration.

Tools & Methodology
Simulation Tool: ANSYS HFSS (3D EM solver)

Design Steps:

Define material stack-up (silicon, package substrate, PCB).

Configure GCPW geometry and bonding scheme.

Parameter sweep for trace width, via size, and ground spacing.
